      Red Hat Developer Hub is an enterprise-grade platform for building developer portals, containing a supported and opinionated framework. It comes with pre-built plug-ins and configuration settings, supports use of an external database, and can help streamline the process of setting up a self-managed internal developer portal for adopters who are just starting out. By implementing a unified and open platform designed to maximize developer skills, ease onboarding, and increase development productivity, focus can be centered on what really matters: writing great code. Red Hat Developer Hub also offers Software Templates to simplify the development process, which can reduce friction and frustration for development teams, boosting their productivity and increasing an organization's competitive advantage.

      System Architects can benefit by implementing a tailored platform with a complementary suite of verified and curated tools and components needed for operations teams to support developersâ€”within a centralized, consistent location. Development teams can experience increased productivity, fewer development team obstacles, and simplified governance of technology choices with self-service and guardrails.

      ## Telemetry data collection

      The telemetry data collection feature is enabled by default. Red Hat Developer Hub sends telemetry data to Red Hat by using the `backstage-plugin-analytics-provider-segment` plugin. To disable this and to learn what data is being collected, see [Red Hat Developer Hub documentation on telemetry data collection](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_developer_hub/1.7/html-single/administration_guide_for_red_hat_developer_hub/index#assembly-rhdh-telemetry_admin-rhdh).
